# Payment Page Implementation for Floww APIs Private Limited

## Description

This is a payment summary page designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Floww APIs Private Limited. The page includes payment details, calculates taxes, and displays the total amount. It also has a "Pay Now" button that simulates a backend payment gateway interaction with a loading animation. The page is fully responsive and includes footer contact details for support.

## Features

- **Header Section**: Contains the title "Payment Summary" and the branding of Floww APIs Private Limited.
- **Payment Details Section**: Displays the following information:
  - Product name
  - Quantity
  - Price (per unit)
  - Subtotal, Taxes (18% GST), and Total Amount.
- **Payment Action Section**: 
  - "Pay Now" button triggers a loading animation.
  - Displays a "Payment-in-progress. Please do not close this window" message with a loading spinner.
  - After 10 seconds, a payment success or failure message is shown.
- **Footer**: Displays relevant support contact details.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage, ensuring it is responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling the payment simulation, tax calculation, and triggering the loading animation.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/payment-page.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```
    cd payment-page
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the payment page in action.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the payment page.
- `styles.css`: Styles the page, making it responsive.
- `script.js`: Handles the JavaScript functionality for payment simulation, tax calculation, and loading animation.

## Assumptions

- The product details (product name, price, quantity) are static for this demo. In a real-world scenario, these would be dynamically fetched from a backend server.
- The backend payment gateway integration is simulated with a loading animation, as no actual payment gateway was implemented.
